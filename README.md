# ToggledLH

Allows expressions to be no-op skipped if a switch is flipped. Useful for self tests.

This is a minor extension of ToggleableAsserts.jl. Instead of only toggling asserts, ToggledLH can toggle arbitrary conditional expressions. But the key implementation is directly taken from ToggleableAsserts.jl.
